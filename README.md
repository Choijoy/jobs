We are powering the next generation of online merchants and connecting them with millions of shoppers all over the world. First, Storenvy is the world's simplest online store builder powering over 40,000 stores. But instead of just a standalone store, Storenvy connects them all into a social marketplace where you can shop and discover amazing things from merchants all over the world in one place.

Here's an example:

Storefront - [cherrysauce.storenvy.com/](http://cherrysauce.storenvy.com)
In the marketplace - [http://www.storenvy.com/stores/453-cherry-sauce-clothing](www.storenvy.com/stores/453-cherry-sauce-clothing)

We created the marketplace because the ultimate storefront feature is *more sales*. And people make loads of sales in our marketplace.

Storenvy was founded by a [https://github.com/joncrawford](Ruby on Rails developer) who decided that online commerce was boring and too complex for average people and who wanted to change that. We are a small, early-stage team with lots of work left to do. We love great engineering and great product. We're hiring great engineers who want to have big real-world impact.
